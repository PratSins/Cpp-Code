Virtual Destructors
    + Problems can happen when we destroy polymorphic objects

    + If a derived class is destroyed by deleting its storage via the base class pointer
      and the class a non-virtual destructor. Then the behavior is undefined in the
      C++ standard.

    + Derived objects must be destroyed in the correct order starting at the correct
      destructor
