Declaring virtual functions
    + Override the function in the Derived classes
    + Function signature and return type must match EXACTLY
    + Virtual keyword not required but is best practice
    + If you don't provide an overridden version it is inherited from itâ€™s base class

/*
A virtual function in C++ helps ensure you call the correct function via a reference or pointer. 
The C++ programming language allows you only to use a single pointer to refer to all the derived class objects. 
Since the pointer refers to all the derived objects, calling it will consistently execute the function in the base class. 

You can overcome this challenge with a virtual function in C++ 
as it helps execute the virtual version of the derived class, which is done at the run-time.
